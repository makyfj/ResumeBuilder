# Techsume

Techsume is a resume builder based on one of my favorite resume templates from overleaf.

I plan to eventually add more resumes templates once the basics of the project are completed.

### Toolkit
- Nextjs
- TypeScript -> Better for development
- Tailwindcss -> Styling
- useState -> This might change to redux toolkit if state management is needed.
- reac-hook-form -> Form
- react-pdf -> Pdf manipulation

### Design
This is a rough solution/design. Once the project has started. I will update with new styles.

### Project based on this template
More templates will be added once the basic needs/styles for the project has finished.
